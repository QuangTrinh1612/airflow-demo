If you venture outside right now in Lipari, you'll find the temperature to be 24.0°C, but it will feel more like 25.8°C. The relative humidity is 44%.

As you surf the probabilistic waves of existence today, 
take these three quotes with you:

1. "I cannot make my days longer so I strive to make them better." - Henry David Thoreau
2. "It is hard to fail, but it is worse never to have tried to succeed." - Theodore Roosevelt
3. "The primary cause of unhappiness is never the situation but your thoughts about it." - Eckhart Tolle
