Hello Cosmic Traveler,

As you surf the probabilistic waves of existence today, 
take these three quotes with you:

1. "I cannot make my days longer so I strive to make them better." - Henry David Thoreau
2. "It is hard to fail, but it is worse never to have tried to succeed." - Theodore Roosevelt
3. "The primary cause of unhappiness is never the situation but your thoughts about it." - Eckhart Tolle

Have a fantastic journey!
